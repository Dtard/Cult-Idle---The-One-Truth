Cult-Idle---The-One-Truth
=========================

WIP incremental game about raising a cult
This is extremely early code, less than a week old.
I'd greatly appreciate any feedback on this project,
email suggestions, or if you're interested on working on this project with me.

The aim of the game is to gain as many followers as possible. 
Followers can currently fulfill 3 roles: recruitment, funding, and distracting authority.
Currently authority suspicion has no negative effects; these will be implemented in the future.
1 button to attempt to convert a follower
3 sliders determine what percent of followers will perform what task
1 bar to track authority suspicion, changes colors from green to yellow to red.
